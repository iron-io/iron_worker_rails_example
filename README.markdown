This project is a sample project to show how to use SimpleWorker in Rails (it's very easy).

When running the application, be sure to set the following environment variables:

```
SIMPLEWORKER_ACCESS_KEY=ABC
SIMPLEWORKER_SECRET_KEY=XYZ
```

These are used in application.rb to configure SimpleWorker.
